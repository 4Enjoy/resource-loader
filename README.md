# Asset Loader

A generic asset loader, made with web games in mind.

## Usage

## Building

You will need to have [node][node] and [gulp][gulp] setup on your machine.

Then you can install dependencies and build:

```js
npm i && npm run build
```

That will output the built distributables to `./dist`.

[node]:       http://nodejs.org/
[gulp]:       http://gulpjs.com/
